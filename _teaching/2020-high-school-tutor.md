I am very passionate about teaching others. 

During the final phase of my undergraduate studies and the early stage of my doctoral studies, I worked part-time as a high school physics tutor, gaining three years of experience in this role (2020-2022). 

Additionally, I took and passed the Chinese High School Teacher Qualification Examination in 2021.
