Abstract
--------------

In this work, we study the images of a Kerr black hole (BH) immersed in uniform magneticfields, illuminated by the synchrotron radiation of charged particles in the jet. We particularly focus on the spontaneously vortical motions (SVMs) of charged particles in the jet region and investigate the polarized images of electromagnetic radiations from the trajectories along SVMs. We notice that there is a critical value $ωc$ for charged particle released at a giveninitial position and subjected an outward force, and once $|qB0/m|=|ωB|>|ωc|$ charged particles can move along SVMs in the jet region. We obtain the polarized images of the electromagnetic radiations from the trajectories along SVMs. Our simplified model suggests that the SVM radiations can act as the light source to illuminate the BH and form a photon ring structure.
