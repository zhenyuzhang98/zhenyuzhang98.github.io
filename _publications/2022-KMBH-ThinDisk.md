Abstract
--------------

In this present work, we study the observational appearance of Kerr-Melvin black hole (KMBH) illuminated by an accretion disk. The accretion disk is assumed to be located on the equatorial plane and to be thin both geometrically and optically. Considering the fact that outside the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) the accretion flow moves in prograde or retrograde circular orbit and falls toward the horizon along plunging orbit inside the ISCO, we develop the numerical backward ray-tracing method and obtain the images of KMBH accompanying with the accretion disk for various black hole spins, strengths of magnetic fields, and inclination angles of observers. We present the intensity distribution horizontally and longitudinally and show the profiles of the redshift for the direct and lensed images. Our study suggests that the inner shadow and critical curves can be used to estimate the magnetic field around a black hole without degeneration.
