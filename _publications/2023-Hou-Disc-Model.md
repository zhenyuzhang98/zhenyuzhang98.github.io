Abstract
--------------

In this study, we develop a simplified magnetofluid model in the framework of GRMHD. Weconsider an ideal, adiabatic fluid composed of two components, ions and electrons, having aconstant ratio between their temperatures. The flows are assumed to be governed by gravity, enabling us to employ the ballistic approximation, treating the streamlines as timelikegeodesics. We show that the model is analytically solvable around a rotating black hole if theangular velocity of the geodesic uÎ¸ is vanishing. In the corresponding solution, which is named the conical solution, we derive a comprehensive set of explicit expressions for thethermodynamics and the associated magnetic field. Furthermore, we explore the potentialapplications of our model to describe the thick disks and the jets at the horizon scale. Our model provides a direct pathway for the study of black hole imaging.
