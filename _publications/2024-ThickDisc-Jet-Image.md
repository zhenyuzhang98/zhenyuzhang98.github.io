Abstract
--------------

Based on the horizon-scale magnetofluid model developed in [2309.13304](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2702555), we investigate the millimeter-wave images of a geometrically thick accretion disk or a funnel wall, i.e., the magnetofluid that encloses the base of the jet region, around a Kerr black hole. By employing the numerical method to solve the null geodesic and radiative transfer equations, we obtain the optical appearances at various observational angles and frequencies, generated by the thermal synchrotron radiation within the magnetofluid. For the thick disk, we specifically examine the impact of emission anisotropy on images, concluding that anisotropic synchrotron radiation could play an important role in the observability of the photon ring. For the funnel wall, we find that both the outflow and inflow funnel walls exhibit annular structures on the imaging plane. The outflow funnel wall yields a brighter primary image than the photon ring, whereas the inflow onedoes not. Based on our investigation, the inflow funnel wall model can not be ruled out by currentobservations of M87\*.
