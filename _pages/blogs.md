2024

	- Installed [*inoisy*](https://github.com/AFD-Illinois/inoisy/tree/master). It took some time to install [*hypre*](https://hypre.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and set up MPI. I haven't fully understood its code yet.

	- Installed [*AART*](https://github.com/iAART/aart). It's easy to understand and use since the README and examples are written in great detail.

	- Found an interesting paper about autocorrelation 2304.03826.

	- Learned the basics of using [PKU's supercomputing platform](https://hpc.pku.edu.cn/ug/).

	- Discussed high-order polarized imaging of thin disk with [Yu Song](https://inspirehep.net/authors/2810992?ui-citation-summary=true). The main references are 1602.03184, 2206.13744 and 2407.10431.
