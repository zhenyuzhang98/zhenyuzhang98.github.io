2024
--------------
- Aug 20, Tue

	- Attended the group meeting of [Prof. Bin Chen](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1013901?ui-citation-summary=true). The speaker of this time was Zhenbang Gu. He talked about some mathematical physics. I could barely understand a word of it.

- Aug 19, Mon

	- Discussed high-order polarized imaging of thin disk with [Yu Song](https://inspirehep.net/authors/2810992?ui-citation-summary=true).

- Aug 18, Sun

	- Revised the paper [2407.14897](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2810002) and submitted the new version to arXiv.

	- Struggled with a SIGW problem. Based on my derivation, Eq. (3) in [2306.17149](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.17149) and Eq. (83) in [2404.06151](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06151) differ by a factor of 2, but I can't find where I went wrong.

	- Attended the group meeting of [Prof. Shi Pi](https://stonepi.github.io). Discussed the calculation of primordial black hole abundance with [Ao Wang](https://inspirehep.net/authors/2718599?ui-citation-summary=true). He believes that both the effects of a broad power spectrum and the shape parameter q can be incorporated into the Press-Schechter method. Actually, I had considered a similar issue last year, so I expressed pessimism. I roughly learned from Wencong Hong how to obtain the sensitivity curve from LIGO gravitational wave data. I also roughly learned from Prof. Pi how weak lensing constrains the abundance of primordial black holes.

	- Reorganized the code about [thin disk imaging](https://zhenyuzhang98.github.io/files/RTthindisk.pdf).

	- Learned something about quasinormal modes. Basically, it involves setting the ingoing and outgoing boundary conditions at the black hole horizon and at infinity, and solving the equations of motion for the perturbation field in the curved spacetime. This approach is feasible because when a field does not have a backreaction on the background, the perturbation in the black hole spacetime simplifies to the propagation of the field in the black hole background. The observational significance is that the QNM will dominate the ringdown phase of the gravitational wave signal. The ringdown refers to the process of the BH gradually become stable after the merger.

	- Attended the group meeting of [Prof. Bin Chen](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1013901?ui-citation-summary=true). The speaker of this time was [Zezhou Hu](https://inspirehep.net/authors/2721583?ui-citation-summary=true). He talked about Carrollian superstring theory.

	- Read an interesting paper about autocorrelation, [2304.03826](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2650195). The authors selected a circle in the black hole movie that approximates the location of photon ring (as defined by Eq. (1) (2)) and calculated the 1+1 dimensional autocorrelation along this line. They claimed that the pattern speed can be obtained through this 2D autocorrelation, as detailed in the last paragraph of Sec. 2.2. Subsequently, they validated the method's accuracy using some synthetic light sources. Finally, they applied it to the GRMHD model library of Sgr A\*.

	- Installed [*inoisy*](https://github.com/AFD-Illinois/inoisy/tree/master). It took some time to install [*hypre*](https://hypre.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and set up MPI. I haven't fully understood the code yet.

	- Installed [*AART*](https://github.com/iAART/aart). It's easy to understand and use since the README.md and examples are written in great detail.

- Aug 12, Mon

	- Learned the basics of using [PKU's supercomputing platform](https://hpc.pku.edu.cn/ug/).

	- Discussed high-order polarized imaging of thin disk with [Yu Song](https://inspirehep.net/authors/2810992?ui-citation-summary=true). The main references are [1602.03184](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1420667), [2206.13744](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2102729) and [2407.10431](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2807814).
