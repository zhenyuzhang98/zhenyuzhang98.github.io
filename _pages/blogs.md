	- Reorganized the code about [thin disk imaging](https://zhenyuzhang98.github.io/files/RTthindisk.pdf).

	- Learned something about quasinormal modes. Basically, it involves setting the ingoing and outgoing boundary conditions at the black hole horizon and at infinity, and solving the equations of motion for the perturbation field in the curved spacetime. This approach is feasible because when a field does not have a backreaction on the background, the perturbation in the black hole spacetime simplifies to the propagation of the field in the black hole background. The observational significance is that the QNM will dominate the ringdown phase of the gravitational wave signal. The ringdown refers to the process of the BH gradually become stable after the merger.

	- Attended the group meeting of [Prof. Bin Chen](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1013901?ui-citation-summary=true). The speaker of this time was [Zezhou Hu](https://inspirehep.net/authors/2721583?ui-citation-summary=true). He talked about Carrollian superstring theory. I could barely understand a word of it.

	- Read an interesting paper about autocorrelation, [2304.03826](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2650195). The authors selected a circle in the black hole movie that approximates the location of photon ring (as defined by Eq.(1)(2)) and calculated the 1+1 dimensional autocorrelation along this line. They claimed that the pattern speed can be obtained through this 2D autocorrelation, as detailed in the last paragraph of Sec. 2.2. Subsequently, they validated the method's accuracy using some synthetic light sources. Finally, they applied it to the GRMHD model library of Sgr A\*.

	- Installed [*inoisy*](https://github.com/AFD-Illinois/inoisy/tree/master). It took some time to install [*hypre*](https://hypre.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and set up MPI. I haven't fully understood the code yet.

	- Installed [*AART*](https://github.com/iAART/aart). It's easy to understand and use since the README.md and examples are written in great detail.

	- Learned the basics of using [PKU's supercomputing platform](https://hpc.pku.edu.cn/ug/).

	- Discussed high-order polarized imaging of thin disk with [Yu Song](https://inspirehep.net/authors/2810992?ui-citation-summary=true). The main references are [1602.03184](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1420667), [2206.13744](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2102729) and [2407.10431](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2807814).
