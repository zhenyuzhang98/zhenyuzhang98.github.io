English name
----------

I found my first name, Zhenyu, is kind of difficult to pronounce for people who are not familiar with Chinese. 

Later, I found that "Jerry" sounds a bit like my Chinese name. 

Now, when I meet new foreign friends, I usually tell them: 

*Just call me Jerry.*

- Aug 18

Some alumni who share my supervisor discussed our academic lineage in a Wechat group. 

They said it's like: Peng Huanwu - Zhou Guangzhao - Wu Ke - Chen Bin - us.

And I found that the PhD advisor of Peng Huanwu is Max Born.
