Some alumni who share my supervisor discussed our academic lineage in a Wechat group. 

They said it's like: Max Born - Peng Huanwu - Zhou Guangzhao (Kuang-chao Chou) - Wu Ke - Chen Bin - us.

(I think that is doubtful since I found the supervisor of Wu Ke might be Lu Qikeng. So it might be : Hua Luogeng - Lu Qikeng - Wu Ke)

Regarding the project that a student look down to, Prof. Shi Pi said, 

*"Do you have to go for the Nobel Prize for every paper?"* 

Impressive to me.

English name
----------

I found my first name, Zhenyu, is kind of difficult to pronounce for people who are not familiar with Chinese.

Later, I found that "Jerry" sounds a bit like my Chinese name.

Now, when I meet new foreign friends, I usually tell them:

*Just call me Jerry.*
